# KnightEye-Timeline  

An Evidence-First Cyber Incident Reconstruction Engine

KnightEye Timeline is an open investigation engine designed to reconstruct cyber incidents from raw telemetry into defensible forensic timelines, cross-system attack storylines, and human-readable incident narratives.

Modern security tools are good at generating alerts.  
They are poor at reconstructing incidents.

KnightEye exists to assemble digital crime scenes.

---

## △ Purpose

KnightEye answers one core question:

> “Given thousands of low-level events, what actually happened?”

KnightEye transforms security telemetry into:

- cryptographically chained forensic evidence  
- structured incident timelines  
- cross-system behavioral storylines  
- investigator-readable narratives  

KnightEye is not a SIEM.  
KnightEye is not a detection engine.  
KnightEye is an incident reconstruction engine.

## △ What KnightEye-Timeline Is

- An evidence-first DFIR backend  
- An incident reconstruction engine  
- A research framework for attack modeling  
- A foundation layer for future security products  

KnightEye sits after collection and detection, where confusion begins.

---

## △ Core Principles

### Evidence Before Intelligence

Raw telemetry is treated as forensic evidence.

KnightEye preserves original data, cryptographically chains events, and separates immutable evidence from derived interpretations.

Everything KnightEye produces must be traceable back to evidence.

---

### Reconstruction Over Detection

KnightEye does not compete on alert quality.

It competes on:

- timeline clarity  
- behavioral coherence  
- cross-system understanding  
- investigation defensibility  

---

### Deterministic Investigations

Given the same evidence, KnightEye should produce the same incidents, timelines, and narratives.

Reconstruction must be reproducible, explainable, and auditable.

---

### Heuristics Become Engines

Stage inference, compression, correlation, and narrative logic are treated as investigation engines, not hard-coded scripts.

They are designed to become modular, replaceable, testable, and researchable.

---

### A Foundation, Not a Product

KnightEye is built to power:

- DFIR tooling  
- research environments  
- training platforms  
- future security products  

KnightEye prioritizes stable models, clean interfaces, and forensic rigor over UI features.

---

## △ The KnightEye Investigation Model

KnightEye structures investigations into distinct layers:

- Evidence — immutable observed events  
- Evidence Chains — cryptographic integrity and lineage  
- Incidents — behavioral clusters of activity  
- Timelines — structured, compressed representations  
- Storylines — cross-system attack progressions  
- Narratives — human-readable reconstructions  

This allows KnightEye to move from telemetry to coherent incident understanding.

---

## △ Engine Architecture (Conceptual)

KnightEye’s internal design aligns to investigation stages:

1. Collectors  
2. Normalizers  
3. Evidence Core  
4. Incident Constructors  
5. Timeline Engines  
6. Correlation Engines  
7. Synthesis and Narrative Engines  

Each layer is expected to evolve into a pluggable, research-capable engine.

---

## △ Research Orientation

KnightEye is intentionally designed as a research-capable system.

It aims to support:

- replayable incident datasets  
- experimentation with correlation logic  
- evaluation of reconstruction methods  
- behavioral modeling of attacks  

KnightEye is both a tool and a laboratory.

---

## △ Product Orientation

KnightEye is built as an engine that products can be built on.

v1 prioritizes:

- forensic correctness  
- architectural clarity  
- deterministic behavior  
- extensibility  

Not surface-level features.

---

## △ Contributing

KnightEye welcomes contributions across three tracks:

### DFIR Track  
Evidence modeling, forensic logic, reconstruction quality

### Research Track  
Correlation engines, reasoning models, evaluation frameworks

### Engineering Track  
Architecture, performance, APIs, integrations, testing

If you are interested in how cyber incidents should be reconstructed — not just detected — you will probably feel at home here.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidance.

---

## △ v1 Objective

KnightEye-Timeline v1 focuses on establishing:

- a formal investigation model  
- a defensible forensic core  
- a modular engine architecture  
- a contributor-ready foundation  

v1 is not feature maturity.

v1 is identity maturity.

## △ Closing Note

KnightEye is not trying to win dashboards.

KnightEye is trying to win understanding.

Understanding of incidents.  
Understanding of attacker behavior.  
Understanding of how cyber investigations should actually work.
